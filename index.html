  <p>The wild blackwater of the Suwannee River begins as gravity naturally drains water from the Okefenokee Swamp and pulls it down 246 miles to the Gulf of Mexico cutting the state into two halves: panhandle and peninsula. The flow of the river is unobstructed, except for a small sill near the headwaters that remains open, which makes the Suwannee unique as the one of the longest stretches of unobstructed river in the Southeastern U.S. Human connection with the Suwannee began when indigenous cultures formed starting nearly 2,000 years ago. By the time the Spanish arrived in the Florida, around 150,000 Timucuan Indians lived in the Suwannee basin. Natives considered the springs sacred, and wounded warriors could rest on their shores without fear of being attacked. Years of conflict with settlers as well as disease led to the destruction of native communities and culture. Military roads developed to help drive out the Indians would pave the way for American expansion into the state that became official in 1845.
